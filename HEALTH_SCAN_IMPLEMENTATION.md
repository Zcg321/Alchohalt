# Health Scan Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the comprehensive repository health scan for Alchohalt, as requested in the Repository Health Scan report.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Health Scan Script

**File:** `scripts/health-scan.sh`

A comprehensive bash script that performs all the checks mentioned in the health scan report:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Validates Node.js version (checks for Node 18)
   - Verifies Python availability
   - Confirms dependencies are installed

2. **Repository Scan and Budgets**
   - Runs `repo_scan.py` in human-readable mode
   - Generates JSON metrics report
   - Enforces strict budgets (file size, function length, complexity)
   - Generates import graph visualization (DOT/PNG)
   - Reports on TODO/FIXME markers

3. **Linting and Type Checking**
   - Runs ESLint for code quality
   - Runs TypeScript compiler for type safety

4. **Testing and Coverage**
   - Executes full test suite
   - Validates coverage threshold

5. **Dead Code and Dependencies**
   - Detects unused exports with ts-prune
   - Checks dependency health with depcheck

6. **Smoke Tests**
   - Generates and runs smoke tests for critical paths

7. **Bundle Size and Performance**
   - Measures web bundle size
   - Checks Android APK size
   - Compares against budgets

8. **Build Verification**
   - Builds production bundle
   - Validates PWA assets (manifest, service worker)

9. **Security and Updates**
   - Audits npm packages for vulnerabilities
   - Identifies outdated packages

### 2. NPM Command

**Added to `package.json`:**

```json
"health:scan": "bash ./scripts/health-scan.sh"
```

Run with:
```bash
npm run health:scan
```

### 3. Documentation

Three levels of documentation:

1. **QUICKSTART_HEALTH_SCAN.md** - Quick reference guide
   - One-page overview
   - Common commands
   - Quick fixes
   - Exit codes

2. **HEALTH_SCAN_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide
   - Detailed explanations of each check
   - Interpreting results
   - Optimization tips
   - CI/CD integration
   - Troubleshooting

3. **HEALTH_SCAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - This document
   - Implementation details
   - Architecture decisions
   - Future improvements

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/post-merge-health.yml`

Automated workflow that:
- Runs after every push to main
- Can be triggered manually
- Generates all health reports
- Uploads reports as artifacts (30-day retention)
- Continues even if some checks fail

### 5. .gitignore Updates

Added entries to prevent generated reports from being committed:
- `repo_scan_human.txt`
- `imports.dot`
- `imports.png`
- `deadcode_report.txt`
- `deps_report.txt`
- `size_report.txt`
- `apk_size_report.txt`
- `security_audit.txt`
- `outdated_packages.txt`

### 6. README Updates

Added references to:
- Health scan command in Scripts section
- New "Repository Health" section with quick overview
- Links to documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### Error Handling

The script uses `set +e` to continue execution even when individual checks fail. This ensures:
- All checks run regardless of failures
- Complete picture of repository health
- Multiple issues can be identified in one run

Failed checks are tracked and reported in the final summary.

### Report Generation

Reports are generated as text files in the project root:
- Easy to read and review
- Can be uploaded to CI artifacts
- Excluded from version control via .gitignore

### Configurable Budgets

Budgets can be overridden via environment variables:
```bash
SCAN_MAX_FILE=500 SCAN_MAX_FN=60 SCAN_COMPLEXITY=20 npm run health:scan
```

Default budgets match the project's ESLint configuration:
- Max file size: 600 lines
- Max function length: 80 lines
- Complexity threshold: 23

### Output Format

The script provides:
- Color-coded status indicators (✓ ✗ ⚠ ℹ)
- Section headers for easy navigation
- Summary of generated reports
- Final status with issue count

## Integration with Existing Tools

The health scan builds on existing infrastructure:

1. **repo_scan.py** - Core scanning logic
   - Already tracks metrics
   - Already enforces budgets
   - Already generates JSON output

2. **Existing npm scripts** - Individual checks
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run test:ci`
   - `npm run deadcode`
   - `npm run deps:check`
   - `npm run size:report`
   - `npm run apk:size`

3. **Existing workflows** - CI/CD
   - `repo-health.yml` - Basic health checks
   - `repo-health-strict.yml` - Comprehensive checks
   - `post-merge-health.yml` - NEW: Post-merge scan

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run complete health scan
npm run health:scan

# Run individual checks
npm run scan:strict
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

### Custom Budgets

```bash
# Stricter budgets
SCAN_MAX_FILE=500 SCAN_MAX_FN=60 npm run health:scan

# More relaxed budgets (not recommended)
SCAN_MAX_FILE=800 SCAN_MAX_FN=100 npm run health:scan
```

### CI/CD

The health scan runs automatically:
1. After every PR merge (post-merge-health.yml)
2. On every PR (repo-health.yml, repo-health-strict.yml)
3. Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions UI

## Generated Reports

All reports are created in the project root:

| Report | Purpose | Format |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `repo_scan_human.txt` | Code metrics overview | Plain text |
| `repo_scan.json` | Machine-readable metrics | JSON |
| `imports.dot` | Dependency graph | Graphviz DOT |
| `imports.png` | Dependency visualization | PNG image |
| `deadcode_report.txt` | Unused code | Plain text |
| `deps_report.txt` | Dependency issues | Plain text |
| `size_report.txt` | Bundle size analysis | Plain text |
| `apk_size_report.txt` | Android APK size | Plain text |
| `security_audit.txt` | Security vulnerabilities | Plain text |
| `outdated_packages.txt` | Available updates | Plain text |

## Exit Codes

- **0** - All checks passed
- **1** - Critical issues found (TypeScript errors, failed tests, or budget violations)

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Use husky to run checks before commits
   - Prevent commits with critical issues

2. **Progressive Budgets**
   - Automatically adjust budgets based on codebase size
   - Gradual tightening as code improves

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Track metrics over time
   - Visualize improvements/regressions
   - Store historical data

4. **GitHub PR Comments**
   - Automatically comment on PRs with health status
   - Show metrics changes vs. base branch
   - Link to detailed reports

5. **Slack/Discord Notifications**
   - Alert team when health scan fails
   - Weekly health summaries

6. **Dashboard**
   - Web UI for viewing metrics
   - Charts and graphs
   - Historical trends

7. **Mobile Build Integration**
   - Add actual Android/iOS builds to health scan
   - Verify app launches on emulators

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review generated reports
- Address TODO/FIXME items
- Update dependencies

### Monthly Tasks
- Audit security vulnerabilities
- Review and adjust budgets
- Refactor large/complex files

### Quarterly Tasks
- Major dependency updates
- Review and update CI configuration
- Evaluate new tools and practices

## Troubleshooting

### Health Scan Fails

1. Check individual reports for details
2. Run specific checks to isolate issues:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   ```
3. Review the last section of the health scan output

### Reports Not Generated

1. Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check Python is available: `python3 --version`
3. Verify write permissions in project directory

### CI Workflow Fails

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review artifact uploads
3. Ensure Node 18 and Python 3.12 are available
