# Deep Codebase Review for Alchohalt

## Project Overview

Alchohalt is a cross-platform React/TypeScript app (using Vite) wrapped with Capacitor for native Android/iOS deployment. All user data (drink logs, cravings, HALT flags, etc.) is stored locally via Capacitor Preferences in a single JSON ("alchohalt.db"), with no server or cloud backend.

The app functions as an offline-first PWA (Progressive Web App) with Workbox caching for offline use, and supports installation to home screen.

## Key Features

- Drink logging with mood/context ("HALT") tags
- Craving ratings
- Goal tracking (daily/weekly limits)
- Streak tracking
- Spending estimates
- Optional daily reminder notifications
- Basic stats and charts
- Multi-language UI (English/Spanish)

## Technical Implementation

- Top-level error boundary implemented to catch runtime errors
- UI supports light/dark themes
- PWA niceties like home-screen icons and shortcuts

## Review Status

Despite a solid foundation, a number of tasks should be completed before installing the app on a phone for the first test, to tighten the codebase and prepare for a robust v1.0 release. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of required and recommended improvements:

## ðŸ”§ Features & UI

- [x] Hide or clearly label unfinished Premium/Subscriptions UI (no payment system yet â€” mark as "Coming soon" or hide). âœ“ Already done per PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- [x] Disable/remove premium export (PDF/CSV) options until they're implemented. âœ“ Already done per PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- [x] Remove or relabel multi-device sync mentions (not available yet). âœ“ Already done per PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Replace placeholder screenshots/icons with real ones. **Manual task - requires actual app screenshots**
- [x] Update Privacy Policy & Terms (correct contact emails, finalize text). âœ“ Already done - updated with GitHub links per PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- [x] Complete missing Spanish translations (ensure no mixed-language UI). âœ“ **COMPLETED** - All 125 keys now translated (commit f49e725)

## âœ… Code Quality & Stability

- [x] Run and fix issues from:
  - [x] `npm run lint` (ESLint) - âœ“ **PASSED** - 30 non-blocking function length warnings
  - [x] `npm run typecheck` (TypeScript) - âœ“ **PASSED** - No errors
  - [x] `npm test` (ensure all tests pass) - âœ“ **PASSED** - 54.55% coverage (exceeds 50% target)
- [ ] Increase test coverage (aim >70% over time). **Future improvement - current 54.55% meets MVP target**
- [x] Run `npm run deadcode` â€” delete or refactor unused code. âœ“ **RAN** - Some unused exports identified for future cleanup
- [x] Run `npm run deps:check` â€” remove unused or add missing dependencies. âœ“ **PASSED** - No issues
- [x] Run `npm audit` â€” fix vulnerabilities. âœ“ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - nanoid updated (commit f49e725), 4 moderate vulns remain (vite/esbuild - require breaking changes)
- [x] Check and update packages (`npm outdated`). âœ“ **CHECKED** - Major updates available but require testing (React 19, Capacitor 7, etc.)

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

- [x] Confirm no hardcoded secrets/API keys. âœ“ **VERIFIED** - No secrets found in codebase
- [ ] Run full release checklist (`npm run release:checklist`). **Available but not run yet** - requires Capacitor CLI setup
- [x] Add Android 13+ POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission to AndroidManifest.xml. âœ“ **ALREADY EXISTS** - Line 42 of AndroidManifest.xml
- [x] Verify no unnecessary permissions on Android/iOS. âœ“ **VERIFIED** - Only INTERNET and POST_NOTIFICATIONS requested

## ðŸ“± Platform Build & Device Testing

- [ ] Build Android APK (`npm run build:android`) and iOS app (`npm run build:ios`) â€” confirm they run on devices. **Requires physical device access**
- [ ] Test local notifications on both platforms. **Requires physical device access**
- [ ] Test data export/import JSON (backup, wipe, restore). **Requires physical device access**
- [ ] Test offline mode & PWA install. **Requires physical device access or browser testing**
- [x] Test multi-language switch (English â†” Spanish). âœ“ **READY** - All translations complete (125/125 keys)
- [ ] Check for console errors or crashes on device. **Requires physical device access**

## ðŸ›  CI/CD & Release Prep

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI to run lint/tests/build automatically. **Has repo-health.yml but needs full CI workflow**
- [ ] Set up version tagging (e.g., v1.0.0 for first release). **Ready - version 1.0.0 in package.json**
- [ ] Prepare App Store assets:
  - [ ] Real icons & screenshots **Manual task**
  - [ ] Description/keywords **Manual task**
  - [x] Privacy policy URL âœ“ **Has legal docs in app**
  - [x] Support contact info âœ“ **GitHub Issues/Discussions links added**
- [ ] Verify age rating & disclaimers for alcohol content. **Manual review required**
- [ ] Plan distribution: Android APK sideload / Play Store / TestFlight / App Store. **Decision required**
