## üìã Next Steps for v1.0.0 Release

### Immediate (Required for Release)
1. **Manual Testing**: Complete all functionality tests listed above
2. **Screenshots**: Create actual app screenshots for app stores

4. **Decision**: Determine if subscription UI should be completely removed or just disabled

### Before Tagging v1.0.0
1. Run: `npm run release:checklist` - automated release validation
2. Verify: All manual tests complete
3. Review: No critical vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. Confirm: Screenshots and store metadata ready
5. Tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Release v1.0.0'`
6. Push: `git push origin v1.0.0`

### After v1.0.0 Release (Phase 2)
1. Implement real payment system
2. Enable subscription features via feature flags
3. Implement premium PDF/CSV export
4. Add multi-device sync (with privacy disclosures)
