# Alchohalt Privacy Policy

## Privacy-First Design

- **100% on-device** by design. No accounts, no cloud sync, no analytics.
- **Local notifications** are scheduled locally by the device.
- **Export/Import** moves your data as JSON between your devices; you control where it goes.
- **Future online features** (if any) will be *opt-in*, with clear disclosures and an updated policy.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Capacitor Preferences. No information is transmitted to external servers.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions or concerns, please open an issue on the project repository or contact the maintainer through GitHub.
