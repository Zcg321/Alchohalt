**Commits**: 3ab778f, 6895242, 727e450

## Previously Completed Work

The following items from the review were already addressed in prior work (per PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):

### Features & UI
- ✓ Premium/subscription UI properly gated with FEATURE_FLAGS
- ✓ Premium export (PDF/CSV) disabled by default
- ✓ Multi-device sync disabled by default
- ✓ Contact information updated with GitHub Issues/Discussions links
- ✓ All feature flags properly configured

### Platform Readiness
- ✓ Android 13+ POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission configured

## Tasks Requiring Manual Action

### High Priority - Device Testing

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Android
npm run build:android
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# iOS
npm run build:ios
# Then open ios/App/App.xcworkspace in Xcode
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Install APK on Android device
- [ ] Deploy to iOS device (requires Apple Developer account)
- [ ] Test local notifications scheduling
- [ ] Test data export to JSON
- [ ] Test data import from JSON
- [ ] Test offline mode functionality
- [ ] Test PWA installation
- [ ] Test language switching (English ↔ Spanish)
- [ ] Check for console errors or crashes

### Medium Priority - App Store Preparation

**Assets Needed:**
- [ ] Real app screenshots (multiple device sizes)
- [ ] App store descriptions (English & Spanish)
- [ ] Keywords for app store optimization
- [ ] Age rating verification (likely 17+ due to alcohol tracking)

**Legal/Compliance:**
- [ ] Finalize privacy policy for app store (can use GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Review terms of service
- [ ] Verify medical disclaimers
- [ ] Confirm alcohol content disclaimers

**Distribution Planning:**
- [ ] Decide on distribution method (Play Store, App Store, direct APK)
- [ ] Set up app store accounts if needed
- [ ] Plan staged rollout strategy

### Low Priority - Infrastructure

**CI/CD:**
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated lint/test/build
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Configure automated dependency updates

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Refactor long functions flagged by linter (optional)
- [ ] Address unused exports from deadcode check (optional)
- [ ] Increase test coverage towards 70% (future goal)

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] Update to React 19 (requires compatibility testing)
- [ ] Update to Capacitor 7 (requires compatibility testing)
- [ ] Update to vite 7 (fixes remaining vulnerabilities)

## Build Status

**Current State:**
- Version: 1.0.0
- Bundle Size: 373.74 KiB (precached)
- Build Time: 3.74s
- PWA Files: 37 files precached
- Test Coverage: 54.55% (exceeds 50% target)

**Quality Metrics:**
- TypeScript Errors: 0
- ESLint Errors: 0
- ESLint Warnings: 30 (non-blocking)
- Test Failures: 0
- Security Vulnerabilities: 4 moderate (non-blocking)

## Commits Summary

1. **3ab778f** - Created alchohalt_review.md with initial review content
2. **6895242** - Updated review with complete checklist and baseline validation
3. **f49e725** - Fixed security vulnerabilities and completed Spanish translations
4. **727e450** - Updated review checklist with completion status and summary

## Next Steps Recommendation

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Build mobile apps** for both platforms
2. **Test on physical devices** using the testing checklist above
3. **Capture real screenshots** for app stores

### Short Term (Before Public Release)
1. **Replace placeholder screenshots** in app and stores
2. **Finalize legal documents** and app store metadata
3. **Set up basic CI/CD** for automated quality checks

### Medium Term (Post-MVP)
1. **Implement CI/CD pipeline** fully
2. **Increase test coverage** to 70%+
3. **Update major dependencies** after thorough testing
4. **Plan premium features** implementation

## Success Metrics

### Achieved
- ✅ All automated quality checks passing
- ✅ 100% translation coverage for MVP languages
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities reduced
- ✅ No blocking issues identified
- ✅ Build succeeds consistently

### Ready For
- ✅ Physical device testing
- ✅ App store submission (after manual prep)
- ✅ MVP production deployment

## Conclusion

The Alchohalt codebase is in excellent shape for the next phase of development:
- All automated improvements have been implemented successfully
- Code quality is high with all checks passing
- Security has been improved with vulnerability fixes
- Internationalization is complete for the MVP
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

The app is ready for device testing and app store preparation. All remaining tasks require manual action (physical devices, screenshots, app store accounts) or represent future improvements beyond the MVP scope.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Device Testing Phase
